# ProteinMPNN_breakdown

The aim is this project to learn details of ProteinMPNN

Aim: I will breakdown the code from https://github.com/dauparas/ProteinMPNN/tree/main

Step_1: knowing training data and how they are curated

Step_2: how protein features are extracted and encoded

step_3: neural network (Graphic neural network-based) analysis

step_4: applicaiton
